## Predicting the 2022 World Cup Winner with Machine Learning

Every four years, countries from all over the world compete to play in the World Cup. Try and try as they all might, only 32 countries qualify for the World Cup. 
These 32 teams then play against one another in five rounds: the group round, the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and then the final match. 
The 2022 World Cup will be taking place in Qatar this November. 
Now, the question everyone is asking: who will win? Which team will come out on top this year? 

We have compiled data to make our prediction on the winner of the 2022 World Cup. Combining both player data (from 2021) and historic World Cup match data (dating back to 1970), we aimed to figure out what makes a team the “winning team.” (The player data consists of who we are assuming will be playing in the World Cup for each country, as the official rosters have yet to be released.)

Some of our features include: 
- Historic match data since 1970
- The number of times a country has participated in a World Cup, round of 16, quarterfinals, or semifinal match.
- The proportion of matches won to matches played in 
- The average amount of goals a country has lost by
- The average amount of goals a country has won by
- The average player's Composure, Ability, Potential, Volleys, and Reactions per Country
- The number of matches a player has appeared in within the past year

Using these features, we ran our model through a random forest classifier in order to predict the likelihood of each team winning each round. Check out our GitHub pages to find out our predicted World Cup 2022 winner! (We do not condone sports betting, but do as you wish with this information.)
